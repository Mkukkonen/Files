Files that I worked on

File: Quick Mileage.xlsx
Made In: Google Sheets

Description: I modified a simple mileage form that the school district I was an IT Aid for to automate and simplify calculating mileage from building to building. 
I was able to find the miles in a PDF provided by the district and converted it to a spreadsheet. I then used vlookup and validation based off the acronym of the building to find the distance between those two points.
I then made it so it would add up those lookups for each line and then it would auto calculate based off of the value placed in B34.
It would then subtotal the values and update the amount to be reimbursed. It then could be printed out and handed to the director's assistant who would then approve and submit the request.

File: PrinterPing.bat
Made in: Notepad++

Description: I created a batch script to ping a printer based off the host name, which at this company I was working at had a set naming convention that simplified the code but using 4 digits to differentiate the printers.
The script would ask for the number identifier of the printer and then after the user inputted the identifier it would ping the hostname once to see if it was online and then give options to ping a different printer, go to the embedded website of the printer or to exit.
If they selected the web app it would open IE and go to the host name.
I made this script to assist both the help desk and desktop support to correctly identify the issue with the printer supply so we reduced misinformation.
